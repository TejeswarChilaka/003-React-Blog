      <h2> AdiYogi </h2>
      <p>
        Over 15,000 years ago, predating all religion, Adiyogi, the first Yogi,
        transmitted the science of Yoga to his seven disciples, the Saptarishis.
        He expounded 112 ways through which human beings can transcend their
        limitations and reach their ultimate potential. Adiyogi’s offerings are
        tools for individual transformation, as individual transformation is the
        only way to transform the world. His fundamental message is that “in is
        the only way out” for human wellbeing and liberation.
