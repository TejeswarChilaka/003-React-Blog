      <h2> About Adiyogi </h2>
      <p>
        On the auspicious night of Mahashivaratri at Isha Yoga Center, an iconic
        face of “Adiyogi – the Source of Yoga” was unveiled by the Hon’ble Prime
        Minister Narendra Modi. Recognized as the world's largest bust sculpture
        by the Guinness World Records, the face of Adiyogi is 112 feet high,
        representing the 112 ways he offered for one to attain to wellbeing and
        one's Ultimate nature. Installed near the Adiyogi is the Yogeshwar
        Linga, which was consecrated by Sadhguru, as manifestation of five of
        the major chakras in the human system. Adiyogi, with the presence of the
        Yogeshwar Linga, has become a living entity.
